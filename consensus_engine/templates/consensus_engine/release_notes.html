<h2>Welcome to the Consensus Engine 0.7</h2>
<p>This application is a &quot;work in progress&quot; to build an engine to collect the consensus of decision across an enterprise.
  The key concepts are below, and currently the application allows only the basic functionality.</p>
</p>
<h3>Key Concepts for Consensus Engine</h3>
<br>
<b>Proposals</b>
<p>Proposals are the key part of the Consensus Engine. Users create proposals and ask people to vote on
them to get a consensus of opinion to show support for the proposal. Each proposal can have a set of choices
that any user can pick, and this is set up at creation time. Currently you can change the choices and the
choices, but this may not be available in the future. Only the user who created the Proposal can edit it.</p>
<b>Votes</b>
<p>Votes are cast for a proposal choice, a user can change their vote as many times as wanted, but each vote is
captured with only the last one counting toward the consensus. By saving all the votes cast we can analyse
the state of the consensus over time. All the votes that a user has cast can be found in the My Votes function
on the task bar.</p>
<b>Consensus</b>
<p>The consensus is currently calculated as the option with the highest number of votes, but the creator will be
  allowed to pick a general calculation - i.e. % of votes, % of members of group, etc (we need to review
  statistical analysis). </p>
<b>Proposal Groups</b>
<p>Proposals can be grouped under a single category, currently I am working on the approach that we will only have one
level of hierarchy to keep it simple. Users can view and vote on the proposals within the groups they are members of.
You can join a group by selecting the icon on the group in the Proposal Group list. Only the user that
created the Group can edit it</p>
<b>Invites</b>
<p>You can now invite other users to a Proposal Group. Use the person icon againt the proposal group and add another user, they
  will then get an invite, which they can either accept or decline. Accepting adds the person to the group.</p>
<h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
<ul>
<li>There shoud be multiple owners of a proposal than can contribute to the proposal before publishing</li>
<li>Improved analysis of voting across time needs to be implemented</li>
<li>Mulitple different consensus calculation types</li>
<li>Allow for Group defaults for choice - so that consensus can be aggregated at Group level</li>
<li>Improvements in User Experience</li>
<li>Menu implementation for iPhone/SmartPhone</li>
<li>Statistics of current vote</li>
<li>News feed of changes to Group and Proposals</li>
<li>API connectivity to vote and get votes</li>
<li>Anonymity of voters</li>
<li>Tagging and searching to create more complex relationships between proposals</li>
<li>Implementation of user management, registration and permissions</li>
</ul>
